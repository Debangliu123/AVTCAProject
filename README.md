# Audio-Visual Fusion with Temporal Convolutional Attention for Speech Separation  (AVTCA) Model
This repository  currently contains  a real-world speech separation result demo using AVTCA.

We obtained several real-world video recordings from YouTube containing mixed speech between two speakers to show the effectiveness of our separation model. The display results demos can be accessed through the following link: 

In this demo, videos 1 and 2 are both front-face recordings of the speaker, while the speakers in Videos 3,
4 and 5 have varying degrees of profile or facial movements.
